	"{b}Thank you for  participating.{/b} 
	{b}What was the study about?{/b}
	This study examined opinions and acceptance of people with different body weights. In particular, whether applying weight labels to obese individuals impacted on obesity acceptance. Across conditions, the photographs that participants saw differed- participants saw either healthy or obese males where accurate weight information was given or withheld.
	We expect acceptance of obesity to increase in trials where participants saw obese individuals without weight information. However, due to the negative connotations associated with being obese we expect acceptance to decline in the trials where individuals saw obese individuals and weight information was provided. This study will help us to understand when and how heavier body weights will become more acceptable.
	{b}What if I want advice about my weight?{/b}
	We are not qualified to offer advice ourselves, but if you are concerned about your eating or weight, we advise you to seek information and advice from your Doctor. As well as this, you could also seek information from these resources: http://www.nhs.uk/livewell/healthy-eating/Pages/Healthyeating.aspx  www.b-eat.co.uk 
	{b}Who can I contact if I have further questions?{/b}
