"Before we begin, please read the following: 
This is an experiment concerned with perceived volume judgements of liquids.
If you decide to take part, you will be asked for your age and sex on the opening page.
You will then be asked to make volume judgements of liquid in a straight or curved glass. The required volume will be clearly stated at the top of the page and the liquid can be adjusted up or down the glass by using the scroll on your mouse/mousepad or the up and down arrow keys on your keyboard. When you are happy with your judgement, hit spacebar and another judgement on the next screen will be requested. Please continue until the experiment finishes. It should last no more than 10 minutes. You will be reimbursed $1 for your time.  
You will be told more about the study and why we are doing this research at the end of the experiment. You may also contact the researcher - David Troy (David.Troy@bristol.ac.uk) - at a later time if you wish.
