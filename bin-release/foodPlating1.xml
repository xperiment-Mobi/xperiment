Welcome to our study! We are the Crossmodal Research Laboratory, Department of Experimental Psychology, Oxford University. 
We are interested in understanding how people associate information across the senses. 'If you decide to take part in this experiment, you will be asked to state your liking of certain food products, as well as to provide us with some information about yourself.
There are not right or wrong responses, please respond according to what it feels right to you. We hope you enjoy it. Your participation is very important to us.

1. BEYOND HUNGRY: You may have a headache. You can’t concentrate and feel dizzy. You may have trouble with coordination. You are totally out of energy and need to lie down. This may happen during a very restrictive diet. 
2. You can’t seem to tolerate anything. You’re irritable and cranky and very hungry, with little energy. You may even feel nauseous. You are at the stage of being famished. 
3. The urge to eat is strong. You are feeling an emptiness in your stomach. Your coordination begins to wane. 
4. You start to think about food. Your body is giving you the signal that you might want to eat. You are a little hungry. 
5. Your body has enough fuel to keep it going and is physically and psychologically just starting to feel satisfied. 
6. You’re fully at the point of satisfaction. 
7. You’re past the point of satisfaction, yet you can still “find room” for a little more. Your body says “no” and your mind says “yes” to a few more bites. 
8. You are actually starting to hurt. Maybe you shouldn’t have had more, but it tasted so good. Or, did you get caught up in the eating-is-the-thing-to-do syndrome because all of the activity was centered around food? 
9. The after-effects feel really uncomfortable. Maybe you didn’t eat all day to leave room for this meal and you feel heavy, tired, and bloated. You no longer feel like socializing; you’d rather be by yourself or go to bed. Did you miss out on the socializing because you felt focused on the food? 
10. BEYOND FULL: This is a typical Thanksgiving Dinner feeling – you are physically miserable, don’t want to or can’t move, and feel like you never want to look at food again." />
