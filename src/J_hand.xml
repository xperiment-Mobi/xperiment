"{b}PARTICIPANT INFORMATION{/b}: Online testing of attention and perception
This is a study run by the Department of Psychology at the University of Bath. Before you decide to take part in this study, please take time to read the following information. Contact us if there is anything that is not clear or if you would like more information.
{b}Background{/b}: This is a study that investigates how we make simple decisions about what we are seeing. Although such decisions will not feel like they involve lots of thought, as scientists we can still learn a lot about how the brain processes information by examining the speed and the accuracy of these decisions
{b}Procedures{/b}: We are looking for adults with normal or corrected-to-normal vision (i.e. glasses or contact lens), who don’t have any neurological disorders (e.g. Parkinson’s disease, stroke or brain injury). The experiment may take up to 20 minutes but should be finished quicker than that.
During the experiment you will first be asked some basic questions about your age, health and handedness. You will then be asked to make a series of judgments about pictures of hands and feet. The speed and accuracy of your decisions will be recorded.
{b}Risks{/b}: There are no anticipated risks associated with participating in this study, although you may find the task somewhat boring. 
{b}Benefits{/b}: There are no direct benefits to you. We hope that this research will help us to understand the way that people process visual information.
{b}Payment / Compensation{/b}
	{b}Mechanical Turk participants{/b}: You will receive the  monetry compensation s specified in MTurk for participation in this study (amount to be determined based on piloting).
	{b}Other participants{/b}: You will receive 1 credit per half hour of participation.
{b}Your Data{/b}:Your involvement in the study will remain confidential and the data collected is anonymous (it will be stored without your name attached). We may share these data with other researchers, however there will be no way to identify you from the research data.

	"DEBRIEF: Online testing of attention and perception
Thank you for participating in this study.
So far it is known that handedness is associated with tiny differences in the way that we process visual information. On an individual level these differences are meaningless – for example, reports often appear in the media saying that left- and right-handed people have different thinking styles, and these are greatly misleading. However scientists have found that by looking at the subtle relationship between handedness and visual processing across large numbers of people they are able to make inferences about how the brain develops and ages, and how visual processing is affected by problems such as brain injury. Most of the previous work that has been conducted on this subject has required participants to attend university or hospital laboratories, which greatly limits the number of people who can be tested. By testing people over the internet we aim to test larger numbers of people, which may make our experiments more sensitive to subtle relationships between handedness and visual processing. The ultimate aim of our research is to use these online tests to examine whether clinical problems such as chronic pain in a limb changes the association between handedness and visual processing. 

The research project is conducted by Dr Janet Bultitude at the University of Bath. If you have any questions or concerns about the study then you can contact her at j.bultitude@bath.ac.uk.
