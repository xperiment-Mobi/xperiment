	"{b}Estimation of Others’ Body Sizes.{/b}---Body dissatisfaction is extremely common in Western society.  Over 85% of women in college report body dissatisfaction, over 75% of adolescent girls want to be thinner, and 95% of female university students would prefer to be smaller. Our aim is to develop new interventions to help people feel more satisfied with their bodies – we hope that this may in future help in prevention and treatment of eating disorders. 
	The first step for us in doing this is to create sets of images of women’s bodies which people perceive as being over or underweight, or neither over- nor under-weight.  We plan to use these images in subsequent studies to try and improve people’s satisfaction with their own bodies. We will also analyse data from this study to see whether there are differences between groups in terms of what they perceive as being over or underweight, or neither over- nor under-weight.
	We are also developing a set of images of different outfits to use as a realistic way of judging how comfortable women feel with their bodies. Part of this development involves seeing how this task compares to existing questionnaires which measure how women feel about their bodies. 
	Please email Dr Helen Bould, the Clinical DPhil student running the study (helen.bould@psych.ox.ac.uk) if you have any questions."timeStart="0"  timeEnd="forever" fontSize="50---18"/>

		<addText  wordWrap="true" text="Thank you for taking part in this experiment. Many women in Western society report that they are dissatisfied with their body. Over 85% of women in college report body dissatisfaction, over 75% of adolescent girls want to be thinner, and 95% of female university students would prefer to be smaller. 
Your responses have helped us to create sets of images of women’s bodies which people perceive as being over, under or average weight. We plan to use these images in subsequent studies to try and improve people’s satisfaction with their own body. Our long term aim is to develop new interventions to help people feel more satisfied with their bodies- we hope that this may in future help in prevention and treatment of eating disorders. 
We will also analyse data from this study to see whether there are differences between men and women, different ages and different nationalities in terms of what they perceive as being over, under or average weight. 
We will also use your answers to validate our new method of measuring how satisfied women feel with their bodies."	y="10%" vertical="top" verticalAlign="top" timeStart="0" width="80%"  align="left" timeEnd="forever" fontSize="25"></addText>
