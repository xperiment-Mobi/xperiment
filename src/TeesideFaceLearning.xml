In particular, people are very poor at recognising faces of other races (‘the other-race effect’, ORE). A vast amount of research has been conducted to understand why ORE occurs. Evidence suggests that it is not due to racial prejudice but rather a combination of perceptual and social categorisation processes that provoke ORE. This experiment will examine peoples' perception of same and other-race faces.&#xD;&#xA;What will I be asked to do if I take part? You will be presented with 4 blocks of 23 faces. One block will display Caucasian faces one at a time and the other block will display Japanese faces one at a time. You will see each face for 15s and during that time you will be asked to rate the face on 5 factors on a 7-point scale: attractiveness, distinctiveness, memorability, familiarity and likeability. You will also be asked to complete a questionnaire assessing how much contact you have had with both Japanese and white British faces. The experiment should take no longer than 30 minutes to complete. &#xD;&#xA;Will my data be anonymous and confidential?  The names of all participants will remain anonymous throughout the project. Data and responses gained will not be able to be linked to the name of the participant and data will be treated confidentially, only used for the purposes stated here and not shared with anyone beyond the research team.&#xD;&#xA;Do I have to take part? No, you do not have to take part. You can withdraw from the experiment without any detriment to you. In order to withdraw at a later date you will need to email the experimenter (using the email address below) and provide them with a password, which you will create on the next page.  The password will be used to identify your data.&#xD;&#xA;Where can I obtain further information if I need it? Further information can be received from Natalie Butcher at N.Butcher@tees.ac.uk, Dr Kazuyo Nakabayashi at K.Nakabayashi@hull.ac.uk or Prof Toby Lloyd-Jones at t.j.lloyd-jones@swansea.ac.uk." timeStart="0" timeEnd="forever" fontSize="16" />

    <addText height="80%" wordWrap="true" text="{b}Participant Debrief{/b}&#xD;&#xA;The aim of the project is to assess the degree to which pre-experimental differences in stimulus&#xD;&#xA;representations, that is attractiveness, familiarity, likability, distinctiveness and memorability, exist within the ‘cross-race effect’, whereby people are poorer at processing faces of difference races to their own, in face recognition. It is important to assess such differences cross-culturally in order to establish whether such factors might explain already differences in face recognition across same- and other-race faces, and also to validate stimuli used in past and future research. We therefore asked Caucasian-British and Asian-Japanese participants to rate a series of same- and other-race faces on the five indices describe above,  using an online experiment developed with Xperiment Mobi software (www.xperiment.mobi) which  is designed for the administering of Psychological experiments.&#xD;&#xA;The face rating measures selected here have been used in previous studies using other racial groups. For instance, Meissner, Brigham and Butz (2005) looked at the influence of attractiveness, familiarity, likability, distinctiveness and memorability on the recognition of White and Black faces by White and Black college-aged males.  Details of their study and findings are as follows:&#xD;&#xA;Memory for own- and other-race faces: a dual-process approach. Christian A. Meissner, John C. Brigham and David A. Butz (2005)&#xD;&#xA;Abstract: The current studies assessed the phenomenological basis of the cross-race effect by examining predictions of various social-cognitive mechanisms within a dual-process framework for both the perception (Experiment 1) and recognition (Experiment 2) of own- and other-race faces. Taken together, the current studies demonstrated that differential performance on own-race faces was largely due to qualitative differences in the encoding of facial information represented by a recollection process. Furthermore, false recollections with high ratings of confidence occurred more often when participants encoded and responded to unfamiliar other-race faces. The theoretical implications of these findings for the phenomenology of skilled perceptual-memory are discussed, and the applied consequences of the cross-race effect as an encoding-based phenomenon are considered.&#xD;&#xA;Thank you for taking part.
