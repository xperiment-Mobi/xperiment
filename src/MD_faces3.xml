"{b}BRISTOL EMOTION RECOGNITION TASK 3 – ONLINE PILOT STUDY INFORMATION SHEET{/b}
Before you decide to take part in this study, please take time to read the following information. Contact us if there is anything that is not clear or if you would like more information.
{b}Background{/b}: This study is being conducted to validate a new East-Asian face stimulus set to be used with the Bristol emotion recognition task. These stimuli will be used in future studies to assess recognition of facial expressions of emotion. This study is a validation study to determine whether images in this new face set accurately depict basic emotional expressions.
{b}Procedures{/b}: We are looking for people aged between 18 and 40 who are currently in good psychiatric health with corrected-to-normal vision. Participants should be native English speakers or have an equivalent level of fluency, and not be taking any psychiatric medication. Participants should not be using any illicit substances (not including cannabis). Participants are free to withdraw from the study at any time and do not have to give a reason for this decision. The experiment may take up to 5 minutes. During the experiment you would be asked take part in a computer task that involves judging the emotion present in a face. All data collected would remain anonymous and you have the right to not answer particular questions and to withdraw your data at any time.  
{b}Your Data{/b}: Your involvement in the study will remain confidential. This information will only be available to research staff and national bodies which monitor whether research studies are conducted properly.  Your study data will be anonymised. This means that it will be given an identification number and any identifying information about you will be removed. Therefore, it will not be possible to identify you by name from any aspect of documentation or reporting for this research study. At the end of the study your data will become “open data”. This means that the data will be stored in an online database and will be publicly available. 
;{b}What is open access?{/b} Open access means that data are made available, free of charge, to anyone interested in the research, or who wishes to conduct their own analysis of the data. We will therefore have no control over how these data are used. However, all data will be anonymised before it is made available and therefore there will be no way to identify you from the research data. 
{b}Why open access?{/b}: Sharing research data and findings is considered best scientific practice and is a requirement of many funding bodies and scientific journals. As a large proportion of research is publicly funded, the outcomes of the research should be made publicly available. Sharing data helps to maximise the impact of investment through wider use, and encourages new avenues of research. 
{b}If you have any questions about the study{/b} please contact Michael Dalili at michael.dalili@bristol.ac.uk.
{b}If you have any concerns{/b} related to your participation in this study, please direct them to the School of Experimental Psychology Human Research Ethics Committee, via Liam McKervey (Tel: 0117 9546832, Email: liam.mckervey@bristol.ac.uk"

Thank you for taking part in this experiment. The aim of this project is to validate a novel East-Asian face stimulus set to be used with the Bristol emotion recognition task. This study is a validation study to determine whether this new face set accurately depicts basic emotional expressions so they may be used in future studies.
In this study participants completed a short version of the Bristol emotion recognition task where they were asked to identify the facial expression of emotion presented by each image from a novel East-Asian stimulus set. We will examine responses to each image to determine whether the stimuli accurately portray the intended emotional expression. 
This research will allow us to assess whether we can use this stimulus set in future studies of emotion recognition and may offer insight into possible cultural influences in recognizing emotions.
