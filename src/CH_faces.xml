"Before you decide to take part in this study, please take time to read the following information. Contact us if there is anything that is not clear or if you would like more information.
{b}Background{/b}: this study is being conducted to collect ‘control’ data on an online version of the Bristol emotion recognition task. Previous research has suggested that clinical populations, for example youth offenders, and adolescents with depression may recognise facial emotions in a different way to those defined as ‘typically developing’. This study aims to collect ‘control’ data that we can use to compare to results from clinical studies.
{b}Procedures{/b}: we are looking for people aged between 15 and 18 years who are currently in good psychiatric health with corrected-to-normal vision. Participants should be native English speakers or have an equivalent level of fluency, and not be taking any psychiatric medication. Participants should not be using any illicit substances (not including cannabis). Participants are free to withdraw from the study at any time and do not have to give a reason for this decision. The experiment may take up to 20 minutes. During the experiment you would be asked take part in a computer task that involves judging the emotion present in a face. All data collected would remain anonymous and you have the right to not answer particular questions and to withdraw your data at any time. 
{b}Your Data{/b}: your involvement in the study will remain confidential. At the end of the study your data will be made “Open Access”. This means that it will be stored in an online database so that it is publicly available.;{b}What is open access?{/b} Open access means that data are made available, free of charge, to anyone interested in the research, or who wishes to conduct their own analysis of the data. We will therefore have no control over how these data are used. However, all data will be anonymised before it is made available and therefore there will be no way to identify you from the research data.
{b}Why open access?{/b}: open access of research data and findings is considered best scientific practice and is a requirement of many funding bodies and scientific journals. As a large proportion of research is publically funded, the outcomes of the research should be made publically available. Sharing data helps to maximise the impact of investment through wider use, and encourages new avenues of research.
{b}If you have any questions about the study{/b} please ask Claire now.
{b}If you have any concerns related to your participation in this study{/b}, please direct them to Dr Anna Adlam, College of Life and Environmental Sciences, University of Exeter, EX4 4QG. (Email: A.R.Adlam@exeter.ac.uk).”"

Thank you for taking part in this experiment. The aim of this project is to collect comparison data from ‘typically developing’ adolescents. The data collected on this task will be compared to data collected from clinical populations in future studies, to investigate where emotion biases may reside in clinical populations.
If you have any further questions after Claire has spoken to you about the study, please feel free to ask her.
If you would like to speak to the project supervisor, Dr Anna Adlam, please contact her via email, A.R.Adlam@exeter.ac.uk"
