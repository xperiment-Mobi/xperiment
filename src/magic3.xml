"{b}General Information{/b}

Thank you for your interest in this study. Please take a moment to read through the following information. To agree to participate, please tick the ‘yes’ box on the next page. 

We are investigating how people perceive sleight-of-hand illusions, and have invited you to take part as a member of the general public. This study will consist of watching a series of short videos and completing a simple electronic questionnaire. The experiment should take about 10 minutes to complete. There are no risks associated with your participation in this study. 

Please note that your participation is completely voluntary. You may withdraw for any reason at any point during the experiment. However, we are only able to reimburse participants who complete the full experiment. All data will be aggregated, and in no way will any individual person be identifiable from the results. The only people who will have access to the data are the researchers listed below. The data will be stored in a password-protected computer and may be used in academic publications and written up as part of a doctoral thesis.
;The principal researcher is Matthew Tompkins, a graduate student at the University of Oxford’s Department of Experimental Psychology. The project is being completed under the supervision of Dr. Anne Aimola Davies, a University of Oxford Senior Research Fellow. This project has been reviewed by, and received ethics clearance through, the University of Oxford Central University Research Ethics Committee. 

What if there is a problem?: If you have a concern about any aspect of this project, please speak to the researcher (matthew.tompkins@psy.ox.ac.uk) or his supervisor (anne.aimola@psy.ox.ac.uk), who will do their best to answer your query. The researcher should acknowledge your concern within 10 working days and give you an indication of how they intend to deal with it. If you remain unhappy or wish to make a formal complaint, please contact the Chair of the Research Ethics Committee at the University of Oxford (email: ethics@medsci.ox.ac.uk, address: Research Services, University of Oxford, Wellington Square, Oxford, OX1 2JD). The chair will seek to resolve the matter in a reasonably expeditious manner." timeStart="0"  timeEnd="forever" fontSize="18"/>

Please Note: We are interested in your first impressions so each clip can only be played ONCE. You will NOT be able go back and replay any video once it has finished.;You control when each video starts.
Before every video, you will see a blank screen.
Press the space bar when you are ready to watch. The video will begin after a 3-second countdown (each of the videos will be less than 30 seconds long).
;After each video finishes, you will be asked 4 questions about what you just watched. The first question will require a written response. 
For the next 3 questions, you will be asked to provide ratings.
;You will now have the opportunity to complete a practice trial. This practice trial is in an identical format to the experimental trials.;

Thank you very much for taking the time to be part of our study. Please feel free to contact the researchers on the email addresses listed below should you have any questions, or if you wish to register interest in participating in further studies.
We would very kindly ask that you do not tell anyone the specific details of this study, as this will confound our results if that person(s) also chooses to participate in this study. 
Your help is very much appreciated.
